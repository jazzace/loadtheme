<p>as @MacDevOpsYVR  conf organizer I aim to have diverse speakers & I work hard  to bring in new faces but it ain’t easy 1/</p>
<p>I set my goal & work hard to make it happen but I have failed every year. It’s important so I keep trying. 2/</p>
<p>“Do right & appear to do right”, Trying & failing doesn’t excuse us but we try. Finding speakers: Twitter, mail lists 3/</p>
<p>matching diverse speakers with sponsors to help bring them in. We’ve had some success but far below what I’ve hoped 4/</p>
<p>potential speakers I’ve asked have said: I don’t have anything to say, can’t get time off work, don’t know you or your Conf</p>
<p>I’m not giving up b/c the amazing speakers & awesome talks we organized are so worth it. I fail & I keep at it. Important</p>
<p>we’ve had zero non-male speaker applications every year but I work hard to go & ask awesome people. Helps.</p>
<p>I ask dozens of people every year. Cool awesome folks on twitter, Slack, in the community to find the few</p>
<p>I think we need to encourage more ppl  in general to speak, to share their experiences. Many don’t want to</p>
<p>also working w/ local diverse meetups, tech groups to reach out to other communities. Not easy but needed</p>
<p>so thankful for those that can speak at conf & we have to work hard to help those can’t so easily make it</p>
