title: The Mac Hardware/Software Obsolescence Chart
---
<p>In trying to sort out what Mac hardware supported which operating systems and what new features, it became useful to create a chart to help visualize it. Since I didn't have a current copy of <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle">OmniGraffle</a> handy at the time, I made a 1920Ã—1080 slide in <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/keynote/id409183694">Keynote!</a> That was 2012; I have regularly updated it since then.</p>
<p>The text colour associated with each model indicates the last supported operating system that Mac can run:</p>
<ul><li>Black text = current and announced versions of macOS (e.g., Sequoia)</li>
<li><font color="839C49">Green text</font> = Sonoma (macOS 14)</li>
<li><font color="D4550F">Orange text</font> = Ventura (macOS 13)</li>
<li><font color="773F9B">Purple text</font> = Monterey (macOS 12)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use the icons along the top (placed chronologically) to see what the minimum version of macOS is that you can use on each Mac (generally, the one that it shipped with). The chart also marks the earliest computer model in each line that supports AirDrop, AirPlay Mirroring, Bluetooth 4.0, Handoff (and a number of other features listed on the Legend page that require the same minimum hardware), Auto Unlock, Universal Control, AirPlay to Mac, <a href="/2018/12/01/colour-deep-and-wide.html" target="_blank">10-bit Colour</a> (a.k.a. Deep Color, 1 Billion Colours), T2, and Apple Silicon. If you need specific details, may I suggest <a href="https://mactracker.ca">Mactracker</a> (another Made in Canada/Alberta resource!) or <a href="https://support.apple.com/docs/mac" target="_blank">Apple Support Documentation for Mac computers</a>. Note that Education-only models do not appear in the chart. The Xserve line is similarly omitted.</p>
<p>For a full-size view of the chart and additional pages with a Legend and Mac models back to 2010, <a href="/assets/files/MacObsolescence2025-03-12.pdf">download the PDF version.</a> You can also click/tap on the item name in the PDF version to go to the related Apple Tech Specs page. Clicking/tapping on the icon will also get you there if there is only one model (if there are multiple models, clicking on the icon will take you to the <a href="https://support.apple.com/docs/mac" target="_blank">Apple Documentation area of their website</a> where all models are listed).</p>

<p><cite>Updated 2025-03-12 to add the 2025 MacBook Air models and Mac Studio. The chart now encompasses computers and operating systems released in 2010 or later (bye bye, Snow Leopard).</cite></p>
