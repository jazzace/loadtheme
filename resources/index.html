title: Presentations and Other Resources
---
<p>This page is designed to share resources that I have created or co-created for Apple-centric system administrators. Unless otherwise indicated, items listed by year are from presentations given at conferences. (Articles and audio interviews hosted on external sites are also included in the list.) You can find my self-published Mac-related writings on the <a href="/index.html">Blog portion of this site</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the resources in reverse chronological order:</p>
