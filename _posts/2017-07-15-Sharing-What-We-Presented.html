title: Sharing What We Presented
---
<p>I’ve uploaded a <a href="/downloads/sharing_what_learned_psu2017.pdf">copy of the slides and speaker notes</a> from Vaughn Miller and my half-day workshop at the 2017 Mac Admins at Penn State Conference. We added a couple of items to the deck from your suggestions. Also, related to the discussion we had on sourcing icons for your presentations, later in the conference, SAP open sourced a tool that they use for extracting and converting icons for Jamf Pro. This tool can be used for other management tools such as Munki, but it can also be used for your presentations (just ignore the icons it creates to represent “uninstalling”).</p>
