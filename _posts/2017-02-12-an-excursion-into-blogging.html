title: An Excursion Into Blogging
---
    <p>To this point, when I've wanted to write articles of interest to the Mac Admins community, I've either posted them on a public platform like <a href="https://www.afp548.com/2013/05/21/deployment-a-pedagogical-manifesto/">AFP 548</a> or to a section of the <a href="http://ucalgary.ca/iaml/help/pro">web site I maintain at work.</a> Since most of the public platforms are more ephemeral than I'd like and a recent work secondment made me realize that counting on my employer for a consistent place to post was not secure either, I decided it was time to join with many of my Mac Admin colleagues and start my own personal blog.</p>
    <p>The good news was that I already had my own <a href="http://jazzace.ca/">domain name</a> and had plenty of experience with HTML and CSS, so I figured this shouldn't be too hard. The next step was to pick my blogging platform. I settled on letting GitHub Pages host my site, even though I had plenty of web space of my own. There were two related reasons:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>I wanted to document the process for other Mac Admins, sharing my findings at an upcoming conference or two; and</li>
        <li>I wanted to start with a platform that others without the resources I had (e.g., they needed "free") could use.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Using GitHub's built-in platform, based on <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll,</a> seemed like a great choice.</p>
    <p>So this is my first post along that journey. I hope to share some useful content soon.</p>
