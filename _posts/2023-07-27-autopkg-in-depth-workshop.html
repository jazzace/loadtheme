title: ðŸ“¦ AutoPkg In Depth Workshop
---
<p>Last week, I had the pleasure of co-presenting an AutoPkg workshop with Elliot Jordan at the <a href="https://macadmins.psu.edu" target="_blank">MacAdmins Conference</a>, back in-person, hosted and organized so well (as usual) by the team at Penn State University. We originally developed the content for this workshop in early 2020, so it was great to finally get to share it with an audience.</p>

<p>Elliot has compiled all our workshop resources on GitHub:</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/homebysix/misc/tree/main/2023-07-18%20PSU%20MacAdmins" target="_blank">GitHub Repo</a> â€” homebysix > misc > 2023-07-18 PSU MacAdmins</li>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/homebysix/misc/blob/main/2023-07-18%20PSU%20MacAdmins/AutoPkg%20In%20Depth.pdf" target="_blank">Slides</a> (PDF)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/homebysix/misc/blob/main/2023-07-18%20PSU%20MacAdmins/README.md" target="_blank">README</a> â€” a compilation of every link from our presentation (and even a few extra examples that were only in our notes).</li>
</ul></ul>
<p>The workshop was not recorded, but we hope to present the workshop again in whole or in part. You should also expect some of this content to be shared on this blog and/or in the AutoPkg wiki.</p>
