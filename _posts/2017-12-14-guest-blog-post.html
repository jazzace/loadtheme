<p>As you may have read online, I’m pleased to be speaking at the Mac Admin &amp; Developers Conference UK (<a href="https://www.macad.uk" target="_blank">MacAD.UK</a>) in London in February. Presumably as a way to promote the Conference, Amsys, the UK training company that organizes MacAD.UK, has asked speakers to write a blog post expanding a bit on what their session is going to be about. Since they already have an established audience for their blog, this should be a win-win. I’m very interested to see how this works out, in case that is something we might want to consider establishing for MacDeployment.</p>
<p>My post is the first off the mark. You can read it at <a href="http://www.amsys.co.uk/2017/12/deployment-need-talk/" target="_blank">http://www.amsys.co.uk/2017/12/deployment-need-talk/</a>. There are some <a href="https://www.macad.uk/2018speakers/" target="_blank">great people speaking</a> at that conference. After what I wrote in my last blog post (“My name on the speaker roster is not going to sell a single ticket”), it’s ironic that my name shows up first on the speaker roster (alphabetically by first name). Keep scrolling, trust me — you’ll see some very fine European and North American speakers there.</p>
