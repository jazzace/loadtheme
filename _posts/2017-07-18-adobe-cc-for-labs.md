title: Adobe CC for Labs

_Post Replaced 2017-07-19_
I pulled my original post after some clarification from Patrick Fergus in the MacAdmins Slack #adobe channel. Basically, I was conflating device-based licensing and serial number-based licensing. Device-based seems to be what other vendors call a floating license â€” Adobe wants to move those people to having to authenticate like a named license. Serial number licenses that Labs use seem to be safe for now.
