<h3>2014 Mac Admins Conference at Penn State</h3>
<p>As with all regular sessions at the Mac Admins conference (where permission is granted), my session on July 9 was recorded and is now posted to YouTube. I've also posted the slide deck:</p>
<ul><li><a href="/2014/07/04/modularimagecreation.pdf">Slide Deck</a> (PDF, 4.3 MB)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQXhTPsUlzI&list=PLRUboZUQxbyXYOdlPJ3xlBKnDZVdCVpDj&index=23">Video of slides &amp; presentation audio</a> (1h16 duration)</li>
</ul>
<p><cite>Update (2014-07-22):</cite> AutoDMG has 10.9.4 updates integrated into the latest version of UpdateProfiles.plist, so no need for Ryan Manly's fork anymore. Just check for updates (if you don't have AutoDMG set to do it automatically on app startup) and it will be downloaded.</p>
<p><cite>Update 2 (2014-07-25):</cite> Anthony has posted his <a href="https://github.com/jazzace/AutoDMG-Templates">AutoDMG templates on GitHub.</a></p>
