title: Slides for Blogging with GitHub Pages
---
<p>I'm providing the slides and notes for the segment on <cite>Blogging with GitHub Pages: A Step-by-step Guide on How to Fail</cite> as part of the larger "Sharing What We've Learned" workshop by Vaughn Miller and I at the 2017 <a href="http://macdeployment.ca/" target="_blank">MacDeployment Conference.</a> Note the style contrast between this presentation and an outline-style segment of our workshop. Check the Conference’s <a href="http://macdeployment.ca/resources2017" target="blank">2017 Resources</a> page for the rest of our slides plus other resources.</p>
