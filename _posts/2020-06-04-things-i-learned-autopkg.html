<p>Here are the slides (complete with presenter script) for my June 4, 2020 presentation at the <a href="https://macadmins.psu.edu" target="_blank">MacAdmins Campfire Sessions</a>, organized by the great team at Penn State University:</p>
<ul><li><a href="/downloads/autopkg_maintainers_psu2020.pdf">Things I Learned from the AutoPkg Maintainers</a> (3.8 MB PDF)</li></ul>
<p>You can also <a href="https://youtu.be/J2OKjsqhRZk" target="_blank">watch a video of the presentation on YouTube.</a></p>
<p>If you are a BBEdit user, I have a new GitHub Repo where I share my Text Clippings to assist with authoring recipes: <a href="https://github.com/jazzace/BBEdit-AutoPkg-Clippings" target="_blank">BBEdit-AutoPkg-Clippings</a>. The collection is fairly small at this time, but I am leveraging Git to sync these clippings among my various accounts (both work and home), so I expect to add more clippings as I need them.</p>
