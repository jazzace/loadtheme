title: Video of MacAD.UK Presentation Now Online

<p>Courtesy of the <a href="https://www.macad.uk" class="website" target="_blank">MacAD.UK Conference</a> organisers, you can watch a video of the presentation I gave in London in February:</p>

<p>A couple of notes on the video:</p>
<ul><li>If you watched the video before 28 March, you may have noticed a cut in the video about 12 seconds in. If you did, the only thing you missed me saying is, “welcome to the second half of the Canadian doubleheader.” I said that because <a href="https://youtu.be/oFPIbLSGdYU" target="_blank">Diana Birsan presented an excellent session</a> just before me in the same room. As of late on 28 March, the video has been re-posted on YouTube with the missing 3 seconds restored! Thanks to Laura and Geoff from MacAD.UK for getting this little problem fixed.</li>
<li><a href="/2018/02/23/macaduk-slides-and-updates.html">In my previous blog post,</a> I provided a couple of updates to the content in the video. A link to the slide deck is also there.</li></ul>
<p>Here’s hoping most of you are moving towards Post-imaging Era practices.</p>
