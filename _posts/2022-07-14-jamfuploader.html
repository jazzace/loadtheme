<p>Once again, I had the great pleasure of teaming up with <a href="https://grahamrpugh.com" target="_blank">Graham Pugh</a> to give a presentation on the ever-expanding set of JamfUploader processors, which allow Mac admins to use AutoPkg to populate and update their Jamf Pro Server. This time, we presented live as a part of the <a href="https://macadmins.psu.edu" target="_blank">MacAdmins Campfire Sessions</a>, run by the always excellent staff at Penn State University.</p>
<p>We are making our slides available with our speaking notes for your easy reference. This includes all of the information from the Wheel Of Topics! A video of the presentation has also been made available by the Conference organisers:</p>
